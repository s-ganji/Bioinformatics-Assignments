## Question 1
Get two inputs from user, then find the global alignment between the two input strings using the affine gap method.
## Question 2
In this question, we intend to implement the Star algorithm using the program we wrote in question 1. As input, give the algorithm 4 arbitrary sequences with a minimum length of 6 and print the output, which is a multiple alignment.
